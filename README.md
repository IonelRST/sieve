# sieve_of_eratosthenes

***Attention!! The demo is a web. I decided to show by this way because it will be more clearer but it could be built in Android, iOS or Desktop!***.

In this project we are building a simple app with Flutter where we can see the iteration of a function that searches for the prime numbers between 2 and 1002. We start at 2 because 1 is divisible for all numbers. 

If you go to /lib you will find all the code

## These are the expected values of our app

## Possible upgrades  
The next step for this app could to be add some input to allow users to do their own searches.
